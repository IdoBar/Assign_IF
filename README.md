# Academic Publishing and Open Access

In the academic world you are being measured by a very cruel metric -- your publication and citation index, which is derived from the number of scientific articles (and books) published, their impact factor (IF) and the number of times they were cited (often measured as ). These measures are closely looked at and compared when selecting candidates for research and lecturing positions and in many cases can determine a career trajectory.

A major emphasis is given in recent years to democratise scientific findings, so academics are encouraged to publish their findings in Open Access (OA) journals, bypassing the so called "paywall" and making them widely available to the public. However, publishing is such journals is often very expensive and can reach thousands of dollars, thus discriminating against students, early career researchers and scientists from low-income countries who are unable to afford it. 

## CAUL APC Agreement

A very welcomed change is coming from The Council of Australian University Librarians ([CAUL](https://caul.libguides.com/read-and-publish)) consortium, who have signed a collective agreement with leading publishers to allow Australian and NZ academics to publish in selected OA journals free-of-charge!

The agreement currently covers more than 5,300 entries (available as an [online table](https://airtable.com/shrv3FyFMLdn8r4tb)), however, it is extremely difficult searching for a relevant journal and more than that, finding its impact factor, which as said, is a major consideration when choosing a journal to publish your hard-earned precious findings.

## Finding a Journal's Impact Factor

Despite its importance, it's not as easy as you would think finding the impact factor of a journal...  
A couple of options are the official Web of Science [Journal Citation Reports (JCR) platform](https://clarivate.com/webofsciencegroup/solutions/journal-citation-reports/), but this service requires registering a user account and logging in (you can use your ANZ University credentials using AAF). In addition this service doesn't allow for batch searching and downloading and again makes the task of finding a relevant Open Access journal's IF very time consuming and laborious. 

Other websites took a step forward and compiled a list of these journals and their IF from the official JCR website and made them available for download in Excel format (in [impactfactorforjournal.com](https://impactfactorforjournal.com/jcr-2021/)) or as a PDF document ([phdtalk.org](https://phdtalks.org/2021/05/download-scie-journal-list-latest.html)), which makes searching through the tables much easier. Furthermore, phdtalk.org have developed an online tool ([journalfinder.phdtalks.org](https://journalfinder.phdtalks.org/)) for searching indexed and OA journals by keywords and/or category, but still, this useful tool does not provide IF for the journals it finds.

## Searchable Open Access Journal Impact Factor Table

This repository demonstrates how these resources can be used to create a searchable database of indexed journals and their IF and it is cross-linked to the journals covered by the CAUL "R&P" agreement.
